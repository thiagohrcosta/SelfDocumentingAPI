# API Development with Fastify, TypeScript, and Swagger
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e95fda63-4071-49b4-89d1-3d6e893d52df)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **self-documenting API** using modern backend technologies. It leverages **Fastify**, a high-performance Node.js framework, combined with **TypeScript** for type safety, **Zod** for data validation and serialization, and **Swagger** for comprehensive API documentation. The project also includes **CORS** configuration to handle secure cross-origin requests.

The API showcases a structured backend architecture with organized routes, tagged for enhanced readability in Swagger. It highlights the integration of tools for input validation, schema generation, and API testing directly through Swagger's interface. Additionally, the project explores the advantages of Fastify compared to Express, focusing on performance, flexibility, and maintainability.
